MazeCraze
=========

Unity C# project that implements a randomly generated maze game. A maze is randomly generated, and the player must find the path to the end. Statistics are kept on how fast the player finishes the maze.

The code is very heavily commented due to project requirements.

To Play
-------

If Unity is installed, the Unity package file ColeFennelMazeCraze.unitypackage can be imported. Instructions on how to play are on the interface during game play!
