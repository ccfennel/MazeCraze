DESCRIPTION

This game generates a maze using a version of Prim's Algorithm, and gives the user input using WSAD to solve the maze. The game records the users time for solving each maze, and keeps track of levels. 

SETUP

Open the Menu Scene. Add both the Menu and MazeGame Scene to the Build Path. When the game is played, a user interface will come up to start the game.

USER INTERFACE

You will have three choices when the game is started: New Game, Resume Game, and Quit. New Game will start a game starting at Level 1 with no user data. Resume Game will start off where the last played game left off. Quit will quit.

HOW TO PLAY

Once you are playing the game, you will see a maze get generated. White boxes indicate the path and black boxes indicate walls. The Red Box is the end goal, and the Cyan Box is the player. The goal is to get to the end goal (Red Box) as fast as possible. You can control the player (Cyan Box) using the WSAD keys.

RECORDS AND LEVELING

The game starts at Level 1, and increases to a new level each time you reach the end goal. Since the mazes are always randomly generated, the game does not increase in difficulty across levels. The game keeps track of records such as Fastest Time and Average Time using the timer displayed in the top left corner of the screen. Levels, Fastest Time, and Average Time refresh when New Game is pressed.
